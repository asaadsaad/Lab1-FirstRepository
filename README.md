# Lab1-FirstRepository

In this first lesson, I learned how to setup the development environment for Android devices and install the necessary drivers to connect the device with your IDE.

I learned also about Activities and the structure of any android project. The XML manifest file and the Java file that extends activity. I learned about the activity lifecycle and I've tested all states methods and how they work.
